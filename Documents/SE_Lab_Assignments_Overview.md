# Software Engineering Lab Assignments

This repository documents the series of lab assignments completed as part of the software engineering course. Each lab focuses on a different aspect of software development, from requirements specification to design diagrams and the final implementation.

## Lab 1: SRS Documentation

* **Objective:** Develop a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
* **Details:** The SRS includes introduction, purpose, scope, functional and non-functional requirements, system requirements, constraints, and other essential contents.
* **Contribution File:** `SRS_Contribution.txt`

## Lab 2: SDLC Model Connect

* **Objective:** Map the project to an appropriate software development lifecycle (SDLC) model or propose a new model.
* **Details:** Justify the chosen model and discuss each step. Update the SRS to reflect this model.
* **Contribution File:** `SDLC_Model_Contribution.txt`

## Lab 3: Decision Tree and Decision Table

* **Objective:** Use Decision Tree and Decision Table to add project logic.
* **Details:** Incorporate conditions and actions related to the project in these diagrams.
* **Updated SRS Section:** Integrated directly into the SRS document.

## Lab 4: Data Flow Diagram

* **Objective:** Design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the project.
* **Details:** Follow decomposition and numbering rules for the DFD.
* **Updated SRS Section:** DFD is added directly into the SRS document.
* **Contribution File:** `DFD_Contribution.txt`

## Lab 5: Structure Chart

* **Objective:** Create a Structure Chart from the DFD.
* **Details:** Transform the DFD into a structure chart, including modules, conditions, loops, and data/control flows.
* **Updated SRS Section:** The Structure Chart is included directly in the SRS document.
* **Contribution File:** `Structure_Chart_Contribution.txt`

## Lab 6: UML Use Case Diagram

* **Objective:** Design a UML Use Case Diagram.
* **Details:** Identify and decompose use cases, actors, and apply UML principles.
* **Updated SRS Section:** Use Case UML Diagram is integrated directly into the SRS document.
* **Contribution File:** `Use_Case_Diagram_Contribution.txt`

## Lab 7: UML Sequence Diagram

* **Objective:** Develop UML Sequence Diagrams for high-level requirements.
* **Details:** Sequence diagrams are created based on the SRS document.
* **Updated SRS Section:** Integrated directly into the SRS document.
* **Contribution File:** `Sequence_Diagram_Contribution.txt`

## Lab 8: UML Collaboration Diagram

* **Objective:** Convert Sequence Diagrams into Collaboration Diagrams.
* **Details:** Transformation of sequence diagrams is documented.
* **Updated SRS Section:** Collaboration Diagrams are added directly into the SRS document.
* **Contribution File:** `Collaboration_Diagram_Contribution.txt`

## Lab 9: Final Project

* **Objective:** Submit the complete implemented project.
* **Details:** Include all project files, codes, screenshots, database files, and the final SRS document.
* **Final SRS:** `Final_SRS_V3.pdf`
* **Contribution File:** `Final_Project_Contribution.txt`
