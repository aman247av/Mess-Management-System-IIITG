# Installation Guide for Mess Management System

This document outlines the steps necessary to install and run the Mess Management System on your local environment using MongoDB as the database.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB Server
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aman247av/Mess-Management-System-IIITG.git
cd Mess-Management-System-IIITG
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install required npm packages:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Database Setup
- Start your MongoDB instance.
- Create a new database named `mess_management`.
- Import any initial data if provided, or allow the application to create collections dynamically on runtime.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory with the following variables:
```
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mess_management
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url
```
Replace the placeholders with your actual MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and Cloudinary URL.

### 5. Start the Application
Run the application using:
```sh
npm start
```
The server should start, and the application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Configuration

- **Cloudinary Setup:** 
Create an account on Cloudinary to manage image uploads and configure the Cloudinary URL in the `.env` file.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:
- Confirm that MongoDB is running and accessible.
- Check that all required environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- Consult the error logs for specific error messages.

## Support
